"""Regression tests for ``OrchestratorEngineAdapter`` cadence parity.

Covers PSM-parity bugs caught after K8s smoke / dual-path review:

- ``initial_tick`` previously read ``self._config.throughput_adjustment_interval``
  (missing ``_seconds`` suffix). The Pydantic ``validation_alias`` only affects
  input parsing — attribute access requires the canonical name. Triggered an
  ``AttributeError`` whenever ``enable_throughput_scaling=True``.

- ``_MERGE_TOLERANCE_S`` was set to ``1e-9`` (float epsilon framing) instead
  of PSM's ``0.5`` (wall-clock-drift padding). With the tight tolerance a
  load tick and a throughput tick scheduled within ~ms of each other failed
  to merge — splitting into 2 ticks where PSM produces 1.

- Hard-coded ``WallClock`` broke replay: plugin scheduler / CircuitBreaker
  / HOLD_LAST cache all read ``self._clock.monotonic()``, but replay
  fast-forwards trace time without advancing real wall-clock. Adapter now
  accepts an injectable ``Clock`` and bumps it to ``tick_input.now_s`` on
  every tick when the clock is manually-advanced (``VirtualClock``).
